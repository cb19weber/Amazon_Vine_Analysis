# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
DU Data Analytics Bootcamp: Module 16 - AWS and Spark

## Overview/Purpose of Project
The Amazon Vine program is a paid service available to manufacturers and publishers that incentivises Amazon Vine members with products to provide required reviews. The task of this challenge was to analyze product reviews and investigate if the Vine program actually creates bias, granting businesses that pay for the service better reviews.

## Results Analysis and Challenges

### Vine Program Results
  <p>Prior to this assignment, I had never heard of the Amazon Vine program. That's probably the first thing you'd notice when reviewing some of the data presented in this analysis. In examination of 1.7 million reviews of tools sold on Amazon, there were approximately thirty thousand reviews that, perhaps didn't go viral, but certainly caught other shopper's attention. Of those 29,517 <i>impactful</i> reviews, only 268 were for products produced or manufactured by a Vine member business. So quite obviously, Vine members are a pretty restricted group. What's the impact of Vine?  Reviews were rated with five stars more often than not: in fact, 55.6% of all Vine product reviews received the top rating.</p>
